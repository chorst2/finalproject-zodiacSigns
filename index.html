<p>Zodiac signs were created based on the position of the planets, the Sun, and the
    Moon when you were born. Each sign holds characteristics about you, your love life,
    friends & family, and future outlooks. You may learn more about yourself by reading
    about your zodiac sign and finding out that many of the fears, flaws, and good characteristics
    in fact do match who you are. There are 12 zodiac signs in total and each one is designated
    for a certain time period throughout the year, if your birthday lands in between the time
    period then that is your zodiac sign. Some signs may be more compatible with each other than
    others and you will learn which signs are most compatible with yours as you navigate through
    this website.</p><br><br>

<p>By clicking on “Zodiacs” in the navigation you will find the personality profiles for
    each zodiac sign along with the signs they are most and least compatible with.</p><br><br>

<p>The “Games” page in the navigation bar will display a love compatibility calculator where you
    will enter in your name and zodiac sign along with your crushes name and zodiac sign. You can
    find what you and your crushes zodiac signs are on the “Zodiac Signs” page. This will then give
    you a percentage of how compatible you are and a little summary of what kind of relationship the
    two personalities would create. Next you will find the Baby Name generator. As exciting as zodiac
    signs are, picking out and thinking of baby names is just as exciting. Just simply click the
    button and a random girl and/or boy baby name will appear for you to add to your list of future
    baby names!</p><br><br>

<p>Enjoy your time learning about the Sun, the Moon and all their stars. Peace! </p>
